<h1>
    Five Years of Us
</h1>
<h2>
    Since fifteen, you’ve been my heart’s delight,</br>
    A spark that turned my world so bright.</br>
    Through every laugh, through every tear,</br>
    You’ve made my days feel warm and clear.</br>
</br>
    Today you turn a brilliant twenty,</br>
    A soul so rare, with love a-plenty.</br>
    Your smile’s a glow, your heart’s a song,</br>
    With you, my love, I’ve found where I belong.</br>
</br>    
    Five years have passed, yet it feels so new,</br>
    Each moment spent is a dream come true.</br>
    Through all life’s paths, no matter where,</br>
    I’ll walk beside you, always there.</br>
</br>
    So here’s my wish on your special day,</br>
    For love and joy to light your way.</br>
    With all I am, I hope you see,</br>
    The greatest gift in my life is we.</br>
    ..........................~ your ARYAN </br>
